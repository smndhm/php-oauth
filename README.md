##Introduction

A lot of APIs uses the OAuth protocol and it's **almost** always the same way to implement them.  
PHP OAuth provide you one unified way to connect to APIs.

PHP OAuth has extends who will let you connect to those APIs:

- Instagram
- MapMyFitness
- Moves
- RunKeeper
- Spotify

Those are the ones I needed for now, so don't hesitate to request for a specific API.
